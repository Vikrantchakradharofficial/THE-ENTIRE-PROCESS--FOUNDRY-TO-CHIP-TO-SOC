## **Chapter 2: Design and Mask Preparation**

**Q3: How is a chip designed before fabrication?**  
Chip designers use Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software to create circuit layouts, define transistor placement, and ensure optimal power consumption.

**Q4: What are photomasks, and why are they needed?**  
Photomasks are templates that contain circuit patterns. They help transfer the design onto silicon wafers using light exposure during photolithography.

## **Chapter 3: Wafer Preparation**

**Q5: What material is used for chip fabrication?**  
Chips are made from monocrystalline silicon, which provides a pure and defect-free structure for circuit formation.

**Q6: How are silicon wafers prepared?**  
1. Silicon is extracted from sand (SiO₂).
2. It is purified and grown into an ingot using the Czochralski process.
3. The ingot is sliced into thin wafers and polished.

## **Chapter 4: Photolithography - Transferring the Circuit Design**

**Q7: What is photolithography, and how does it work?**  
Photolithography is a process where UV light is used to transfer patterns from a photomask onto a silicon wafer coated with a photosensitive material.

**Q8: What are the steps in the photolithography process?**  
1. Coat the wafer with a light-sensitive material (photoresist).
2. Align and expose the wafer using the photomask.
3. Develop the exposed photoresist.
4. Hard-bake and inspect for alignment errors.

## **Chapter 5: Doping and Ion Implantation**

**Q9: What is doping in semiconductor fabrication?**  
Doping is the process of introducing impurities (like phosphorus or boron) to modify the electrical properties of silicon.

**Q10: How is doping performed?**  
- **Ion Implantation:** High-energy ions are bombarded onto the wafer.
- **Diffusion:** Heat is used to distribute the dopants evenly.

## **Chapter 6: Etching - Removing Unwanted Material**

**Q11: Why is etching important in chip manufacturing?**  
Etching removes unneeded material to create intricate circuit patterns.

**Q12: What are the types of etching?**  
1. **Wet Etching:** Uses chemical solutions to dissolve material.
2. **Dry Etching (Plasma Etching):** Uses ionized gases for precise material removal.

## **Chapter 7: Deposition - Building Up Layers**

**Q13: What is material deposition, and why is it needed?**  
Deposition is the process of adding thin films of conductive and insulating materials to form circuit layers.

**Q14: What are the types of deposition methods?**  
1. **Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)**
2. **Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)**
3. **Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)**

## **Chapter 8: Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)**

**Q15: Why is CMP required in chip manufacturing?**  
CMP smoothens wafer surfaces by removing excess material and ensuring uniformity.

**Q16: How does CMP work?**  
It uses chemical reactions and mechanical polishing to create a flat wafer surface.

## **Chapter 9: Interconnects and Metallization**

**Q17: How are different circuit layers connected?**  
Metallization forms interconnects using conductive materials (like copper or aluminum) to link transistors and circuits.

**Q18: What process is used for metallization?**  
- **Electroplating:** Depositing a thin layer of metal.
- **Chemical Etching:** Defining metal pathways.

## **Chapter 10: Final Testing and Packaging**

**Q19: How is a chip tested for defects?**  
Each wafer undergoes electrical testing using probe stations before it is diced into individual chips.

**Q20: What happens during chip packaging?**  
1. The chip is cut from the wafer.
2. It is mounted on a substrate.
3. A protective casing is applied.
